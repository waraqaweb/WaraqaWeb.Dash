### Production deploy (DigitalOcean droplet) — safe-by-default (daily)

cd /opt/waraqa

chmod +x deploy/scripts/deploy.sh

# Recommended (fast): pull prebuilt images from GHCR
./deploy/scripts/deploy.sh pull

# Alternative (builds on droplet): rebuild changed services only
./deploy/scripts/deploy.sh auto

# Force rebuild everything (slow)
./deploy/scripts/deploy.sh all
